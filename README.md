# README

An application that lets you get more info on your favorite tv shows.

This project was built using Ruby on Rails as well as Javascript and JQuery. I chose those technologies since they both are frameworks I am familiar with as well as being easy to use. I also went with materialize instead of bootstrap since I wanted to experiment with it as I had not had a chance to previously use it. Had I had more time I would have written more tests as well as spent more time on the CSS portion of the project. I would have also liked to have added movies.
